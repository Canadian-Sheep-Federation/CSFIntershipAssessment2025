## Video Processing Pipeline

The section `video_processing_pipeline.ipynb` simulates how a model that can identify carrots in still images might also be extended to handle live video. The idea is to process each frame of a video feed, detect any carrots, and log the detection time. While the actual model is simulated here, the structure demonstrates how real-time video input could be connected to a detection system.

A small code snippet is included that logs any detections to a CSV file. In a real-world application, this could help track the presence of items over time, such as in a grocery store setting.

## Demo

The notebook `toy_classification.ipynb` shows a basic classification task using logistic regression. It walks through:
- Creating synthetic data
- Training a classifier
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Plotting the prediction results

This demo illustrates core concepts in machine learning classification using simple, interpretable data. It serves as a quick proof of understanding for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
