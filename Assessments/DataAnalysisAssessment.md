# Background

As a Data Analyst Intern at the CSF, you will be tasked with analyzing data sets and make key inferences from them.

# Assessment

Create a jupyter notebook that analyzes the Canadian Cheese directory data set cross referenced with temperature in the provinces. Provide a few paragraphs of discussion of this.

In the notebook answer the following:
- Are there any inferences you can make about the relationship between the weather in a province and the cheese produced?
- Create two different data visualizations. These can be charts or whatever you would like.

This assessment has a lot of freedom, so be creative and show us what you can do with data. Bonus points for demonstration of any sort of data pipeline or cleaning skills.
