**Candidate:** Aashi Arora  
**Internship Role:** Data Analyst Intern – Canadian Sheep Federation  
**Submission:** Summer 2025 Assessment

## 🧀 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between **cheese production characteristics** and **provincial climate (temperature)** across Canada.

Using two datasets:
- The **Canadian Cheese Directory**
- A **provincial weather dataset**

I explored how temperature may influence cheese types, moisture content, and regional production trends.

---

## 📊 Key Deliverables

- Cleaned and merged datasets using province-level data
- Explored cheese type, fat level, and moisture distribution
- Visualized relationships between temperature and cheese characteristics
- Provided interpretation and discussion of findings

---

## ✅ Key Findings

- Warmer provinces (e.g., AB, ON) are associated with higher-moisture and harder cheeses.
- Hard and veined cheeses tend to be produced in **warmer climates**.
- Soft and semi-soft cheeses are more common in **cooler regions**.
- Quebec leads in both cheese variety and volume of production.
